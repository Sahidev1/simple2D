This is a simple 2D graphics engine library written in C on top of SDL2. 
simple2D is a wrapper library that uses a subset of SDL2's functionalities through a simple and straightforward interface. 
It's particularly suitable for less complex projects, and graphics needs. It also suitable for simpler 2d game development.

Sample programs using the library can be found in /sampleprograms directory. 

I made this library because it is something I've always needed, a simple 2D graphics library for potential projects.

For compiling programs using the library you need SDL2, SDL2/SDL_image, SDL2/SDL_ttf
